# Constructing-a-Water-Quality-Index
This study presents the development of a comprehensive Water Quality Index (WQI) tailored for India, utilizing an extensive dataset comprising various water quality parameters collected from multiple districts across all states over several years. The methodology commenced with data preprocessing and the creation of a labeled training dataset, where each parameter measurement was classified as indicative of healthy water based on the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) limits. A neural network was subsequently trained to predict the healthiness of water using these parameters. To ascertain the relative significance of each parameter in determining water quality, advanced model interpretation techniques such as Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) and Shapley values were employed to derive their respective weights for the additive WQI. Following this, sub-indices for individual parameters were formulated, and overall index values were calculated to reflect the water quality status. The resulting WQI was visualized through heatmaps, highlighting spatial and temporal variations in water quality across different states and years. This index provides a robust and scalable tool for monitoring water quality, facilitating informed decision-making for environmental management, policy formulation, and public health initiatives in India.
